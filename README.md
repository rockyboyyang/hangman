### Rules to play hangman
- you have six lives, when the whole body is drawn, you will automatically lose

- if you guess all the letters in the word, you have to type the word(s) in the input box to win (including space if the word to guess is more than one word).

- Guessing the word or letter incorrectly will add a body part and thus penalize the user.

- When guessing, it is not case sensitive!

- A letter that has been guessed will not allowed to be guessed anymore.

- Refreshing/Exiting out of the page will start over the game.
